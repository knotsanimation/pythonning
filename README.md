low-level python library providing convenient functions and components for working with
python. 

Intention being that you could share this module with anyone
that have **just python** installed and it will work. Anyone meaning 
a friend, a data-sciencist, a random internet-people.

This imply this package CAN'T have any external dependencies.

## prerequisites

- python 3.7+
- this is a [rez](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/rez) package made to
work in the context of a rez infrastructure. But as mentioned **the actualy library
doesn't need rez to work.**
